            <p className="hero-section-description">Hey there, I'm Sammi, also known as Samantha, if you want to be formal. I made my grand entrance into the tech world in 2019, armed with nothing but sheer determination and a knack for problem-solving. For the past 5 years, I've been on the front lines as a Support Engineer, honing my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript like a seasoned warrior.</p>
            <p className="hero-section-description">My superpower? I can track down bugs faster than a caffeine-fueled Sherlock Holmes and find fixes that make even the toughest coding conundrums surrender. My passion for coding is unwaveringâ€”I'm always hungry to learn more. Currently, I'm diving deep into the realms of React and WordPress, eager to expand my coding horizons and craft some seriously awesome front-end magic.</p>
